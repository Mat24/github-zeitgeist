## Add your own events

Adding your own events it's very simple. 

Go to 'db/seeds.rb'. 

You have an example already there. 

An event have the following form: 

```ruby
event = Event.new
event.title = Event title
event.description = A description of the event
event.media = A link to an image or video
event.media_attribution = The attribution to the used media
event.media_description = A caption that explains the used media
event.since = The event start date
event.until = The event end date
event.compare = 1: If you want to compare the selected period with the same period last month, 2: If you want to compare the selected dates with the same period last year
event.category = A category for the event
event.keyword_push = The keyword used to analyze if a word occurence increased in a certain period of time in PushEvents
event.keyword_repos = The keyword used to analyze if a word occurence increased in a certain period of time in new created repositories
event.language = A valid language used to analyze if the PushEvents increased for a certain language in a period of time.
event.save
```

Be sure to execute 'rake db:seed' or 'rake db:setup' after you modify the file.
